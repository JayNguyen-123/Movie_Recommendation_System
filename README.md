# Movie_Recommendation_System 
We will attempt at implementing a few recommendation algorithms (content based, popularity based and collaborative filtering) 
and try to build an ensemble of these models to come up with our final recommendation system.
we have two MovieLens datasets.

. The Full Dataset: Consists of 26,000,000 ratings and 750,000 tag applications applied to 45,000 movies by 270,000 users. Includes tag genome data with 12 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags.
. The Small Dataset: Comprises of 100,000 ratings and 1,300 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 700 users.
